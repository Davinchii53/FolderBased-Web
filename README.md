This is my own personal project. i'm planning on making a web-based folder AI that will help college students learn more easily. Currently, I'm working on front-end UI, planning concept. My vision for this project is to help me and others who struggles to study.

For now, This still a concept and in developement. How this work is student will make a card (folder), inside it, there's a milestone goal, created by the student themselves. On the right section, there will be a chat session. This chat is planned to be using Gemini. What i'm planning to do is the AI won't be lost context, with the material that's been given by the student. With it, AI can read what's inside and keep it in its memory, so it won't lost context and can give an accurate response.

After this, i'm planning the AI to have ability to see/read other chats as long as it's on the same folder.
